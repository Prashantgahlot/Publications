# Pintle Injector Spray Combustion â€“ ANSYS Fluent Simulation

This repository contains the core setup and documentation for my Bachelor's thesis project, presented at ILASS-America 2021.

## Project Summary
Simulated spray combustion of a pintle injector configuration using ANSYS Fluent. Analyzed droplet breakup, spray pattern, and combustion stability.

## Highlights
- Velocity contour and droplet Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) profile analysis
- Steady-state and transient combustion simulations
- Post-processing using Fluent built-in tools and MATLAB

## Files Included
- `ILASS2021_Abstract.pdf`: Conference abstract submitted and presented
- `/results/`: Sample visualizations (velocity fields, temperature contours, droplet paths)
- `/case-files/`: Fluent case setup files (if shareable)

## Future Work
- Extend to 3D combustion chamber modeling
- Coupling with NASA CEA for pre-processing of propellant properties
